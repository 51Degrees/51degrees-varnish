The path to the data need to be updated before running the example.

Access localhost:8080 from a browser which supports client-hints. the output will show first the
device properties from the standard headers alone. By clicking the "Make second request" button,
the properties will refresh using the client-hint headers fetched from the browser.

Expected output:
```
User Agent Client Hints Example
Select the Make second request button below, to use User Agent Client Hint headers in evidence for device detections.

Browser Vendor: Google
Browser Name: Chrome
Browser Version: 91

<h2>User Agent Client Hints Example</h2>

<p>
    By default, the user-agent, sec-ch-ua and sec-ch-ua-mobile HTTP headers
    are sent.
    <br />
    This means that on the first request, the server can determine the
    browser from sec-ch-ua while other details must be derived from the
    user-agent.
    <br />
    If the server determines that the browser supports client hints, then
    it may request additional client hints headers by setting the
    Accept-CH header in the response.
    <br />
    Select the <strong>Make second request</strong> button below,
    to use send another request to the server. This time, any
    additional client hints headers that have been requested
    will be included.
</p>
<button type='button' onclick='redirect()'>Make second request</button>

<script>
    // This script will run when button will be clicked and device detection request will again
    // be sent to the server with all additional client hints that was requested in the previous
    // response by the server.
    // Following sequence will be followed.
    // 1. User will send the first request to the web server for detection.
    // 2. Web Server will return the properties in response based on the headers sent in the request. Along
    // with the properties, it will also send a new header field Accept-CH in response indicating the additional
    // evidence it needs. It builds the new response header using SetHeader[Component name]Accept-CH properties
    // where Component Name is the name of the component for which properties are required.
    // 3. When 'Make second request' button will be clicked, device detection request will again
    // be sent to the server with all additional client hints that was requested in the previous
    // response by the server.
    // 4. Web Server will return the properties based on the new User Agent Client Hint headers
    // being used as evidence.
